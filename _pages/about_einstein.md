I'm a Ph.D. student in Software Engineering at the University of California, Irvine, advised by [Prof. Iftekhar Ahmed](https://ics.uci.edu/~iftekha/) in the [STAIRS](https://stairs.ics.uci.edu/) lab. My research focuses on leveraging large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems to enhance automated software development and testing. Iâ€™m particularly interested in exploring how prompting strategies and agent collaboration can improve reasoning, code quality, and reliability in complex software tasks.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
